			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Mob Together exists to help local lds communites create meaningful, high-energy social experiences by gathering real-time activity preferences from the local young single adults. Through a fun, engaging swipe based app, it identifies what people genuinely want to do and takes that data to make curated group activites. The purpose is to remove the hardships of planning, bad communication, and lack of ideas, and work to strengthen connections and make it easier to YSA groups to "mob" together. It will encourage people to use the app by users recieving points for every "action" (voting, pitching, logging in) and keeping an updated leaderboard.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Mob Together is designed for YSA groups who want to be more active and better with planning but struggle with communication, coordination, and knowing what others actually want to do. The audience is anyone within a YSA group. Wether spontanious or well planned, socially motivated, easy, and low stress decision makers. They value experiences and others opinions, community, and new ideas. The webpage also supports group leaders who want data-driven insights to create events people may enjoy. The leaderboard would also be helpful for members of the ward and stake, to see who is involved, and who might need someone reaching out and personal invites to activities.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The site will use JavaScript to create interative features that users use to submit activity preferences and see group consenses. Some of the dynamic elements that will be used are swipe based voting, like using left and right swipes or buttons. Live tracking, where users vote and their choices are saved locally (hypothetically and eventually to a backend) and updated. Activity cards that will load and disappear to feel responsive and fun. Form handling and validation for sign ups and submitting ideas. These dynamic elements will make the site feel more like a modern mobile app and keep users engaged.</p>
